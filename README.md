# Run
For the correct and fast operation of the script, I advise you to turn off the antivirus. 
To run the script, you need to put the images that will be used in the mosaic in the "/input" folder (you need a large number of images), and the images that need to be converted into a mosaic in the "/enter" folder. Ð¡onfigure the parameters in the main() function, run the script.
# System requirements:
RAM: >8 GB;
CPU: >2.4 GHz x2
# Optional:
You can download mosaic images from Google Drive:
